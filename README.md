This is just a simple emulator that one can use to gain a better understanding of Assembly languages
Here I have uploaded just the code and some test files you will have to make your own C++ Project and add these to it I have also added 
a sheet explaining and listing each command available to you in the language.  With this you can effectively write simple code
in assembly language, run it, and get the correct answer.

Cheers!
